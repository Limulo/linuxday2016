12V 1 Channel Relay Module With Optocoupler H / L Level Trigger For Arduino 

## Feature: 
* Working voltage 12V High / Low level changeable 
* Normally open interfaces maximum load: AC 250V / 10A, DC 30V / 10A
* Using SMD optocoupler isolation, driving ability, stable performance.
* Trigger current 5mA 
* Fault-tolerant design, even if the control line is broken, the relay will not operate 
* The power indicator (green), the relay status indicator (red) 
* The interface design of human nature, all interfaces are available through a direct connection terminal leads, very convenient 
* Size: 4.9 x 2.5 x 2cm 

## Module interface: 
* DC+: positive power supply (VCC) 
* DC-: negative power supply (GND) 
* IN: can be high or low level control relay 

## Relay outputs: 
* NO: normally open relay interface;
* COM: common interface relays;
* NC: normally closed relay interface;

## High and low level trigger options: 
It is low level trigger when jumper connect to LOW pin. It is high level trigger when jumper connect to HIGH pin 

Package included: 1 x 12V 1 channel relay module
