# Useful libraries

## Station 1
Per far funzionare gli sketch della stazione sono necessario le seguenti librerie esterne

### for Arduino
* [Adafruit Pixie](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Pixie), a library by **Adafruit** that makes it simple to control _Pixie_ LEDs;

### for PureData
* [iemnet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pure-data/files/libraries/iemnet/) v0.1: a PureData library by variuos authors foundamental to make PureData communicate using TCP or UPD protocols.
* [OSC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pure-data/files/libraries/OSC/) v0.2: a PureData library by Martin Peach. It is useful to send, receive, pack and unpack OSC messages between PureData and other applications;
* [comport](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pure-data/files/libraries/comport/) v0.2: a PureData library by Winfried Ritsch. Useful to send and receive messages via serial protocol. We use che **[comport]** object to communicate with an _Arduino_ board!

### for Processing
* [oscP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/), a great library by **Andreas ?sojamo' Schlegel** that gives to Processing the capability of sendign and receiving OSC messages;

## Station 7

### for Arduino
* **LimuloMPR121**: this library is a remix by _limulo.net_ of the [AdafruitMPR121](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPR121_Library/archive/master.zip) library by **Adafruit**. We have added some more functionality to obtain maximum control on the MPR121;
